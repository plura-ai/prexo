## Prexo AI
[Prexo AI](https://prexoai.xyz) is an open-source Software as a Service that integrates AI agents to enhance sales and customer support systems. But do we really need AI agents here? let's see.

## The Traditional Approach

Let's say you are a SaaS owner and you are trying to sell a product to a customer. You have a list of customers and you want to sell them a product. You can do this manually by sending them an email or a message. But this is not efficient and it's not scalable.

So you decide to use a CRM to manage your customers and sales. You can use a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot to manage your customers and sales. But this is not efficient and in order to scale you need to hire more man force.

That's how most of the SaaS owners are doing it. But what if you could use AI to automate this process?

## The AI Approach

Now a days we have AI agents that can help us to automate this process.

We in Plexy Community have built a SaaS called [Prexo AI](https://prexoai.xyz) that can help you to automate this process.

Prexo AI provides you with a set of AI agents in both free and paid plans. You can configure these agents to help you to automate this process.

## AI Chat SDK

This is a React & TypeScript SDK that you can use to integrate [Prexo AI Chat bot](/app/ai-chat-sdk/intro) in your website.
It internally uses the [Prexo API](/app/api/intro) to get the response from the AI agents. In order to configure the AI agents or your custom redis database or custom vector database you can do it while initializing the SDK.

Please follow these steps to [Get Started](/app/quick-start) quickly.
